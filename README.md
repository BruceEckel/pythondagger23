# pythondagger23
https://pythonhosted.org/dagger/ modified to work with both Python 2 and Python 3

This is Remik Ziemlinski's 2012 **dagger** library with fixes so that it will work with Python 2/3.

All the tests and the benchmarks should work, however I didn't touch `setup.py` so that might still be wrong.

To install:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/BruceEckel/pythondagger23
```
Or, if you've downloaded and unpacked the zip file:
```
python setup.py install
```
